# Minesweeper

I made this minesweeper project back in high school and updated it today to have no global variables.
I plan on adding the feature where you can click on one 0 and it automatically clicks on all adjacent ones

## How to Run

1. Activate venv

```
cd ./venv
./Scripts/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
