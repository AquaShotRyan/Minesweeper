I made this minesweeper project back in high school and it was sphaghetti code.
But with the skills I've learned now, I finally added recursion and made it more readable

## How to Run

1. Install Python (this used 3.10.4, it can probably run on 3.10+)

2. Create a virtual environment

```
python -m venv <folder name>
cd ./<folder name>
```

3. Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/AquaShotRyan/Minesweeper.git
```

4. Activiate virtual environment

```
./Scripts/activate
```

5. Install dependencies

```
cd Minesweeper
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

6. Run the game

```
python main.py
```

## How to Play

- The same as classic minesweeper; you win by clicking all the safe tiles
- `F` to place a flag down
